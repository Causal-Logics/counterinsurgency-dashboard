Game Agentic Monte Carlo Simulation of Causal Logics in Counterinsurgency Operations
- Structural causal logics often characterizes decisions made because of physical constraints, resources, or materials
- Ideational causal elements include decisions derived from practices, symbols, norms, grammars, models, beliefs, ideas, and identities that carry meaning about the world
- Institutional causal logics are derived from local or national hierarchies or institutions that lead actors to a specific path of decision making
- Psychological causal elements are derived from hard-wired mental processes that may appear to make an actor seem irrational
- Military position can be offensive or defensive
